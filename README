INTRODUCTION

    NOTICE: this version is just a stub, Pod::GroveBuilder is not yet
            implemented.

    Pod::GroveBuilder uses Pod::Parser to create SGML::Grove objects.
    The grove objects can then be used with other modules that accept
    them, including writing SGML/XML with SGML::Writer, formatting
    with Quilt, or performing multiple passes or working with multiple
    PODs at the same time using SGML::Grove.

    See the file Changes for user-visible changes.  See
    Pod::GroveBuilder for usage.  See SGML::Grove for details on what
    to do with the grove after it's loaded.

    Newer versions of this module can be found at
    <ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/gdo/>.  Pod::GroveBuilder shares a
    mailing list with Quilt.  To subscribe to the Quilt mailing list,
    send a message with the word `subscribe' in the Subject: field to
